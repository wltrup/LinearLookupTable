## What

**LookupTable** is a Swift Package Manager package for iOS/tvOS (10.0 and above), watchOS (4.0 and above), and macOS (10.14 and above), under Swift 5.0 and above,  that efficiently implements a generic (in the Swift sense) linearly-interpolated and dynamically-sampled look-up table: given a function `f(x)` and its derivative `f'(x)`, a table is built that stores values of `x` and `f(x)` at specific points in some interval `[a,b]` provided by the client code. The derivative is necessary to dynamically determine  where to sample `f(x)` for maximum efficiency and accuracy.

```swift
public struct LookupTable <T: BinaryFloatingPoint> {

    /// The lower end of the closed interval `[a,b]` for which to build the look-up table.
    /// Note that `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition `a < b`.
    public let a: T

    /// The upper end of the closed interval `[a,b]` for which to build the look-up table.
    /// Note that `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition `a < b`.
    public let b: T

    /// The smallest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    /// Note that `dxMin` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    public let dxMin: T

    /// The largest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    /// Note that `dxMax` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    public let dxMax: T

    /// The desired precision for the dependent values `f(x)`.
    /// Note that `df` must satisfy the condition `df > 0`.
    public let df: T

    /// The number of pairs of values `(x, f(x))` stored in the table.
    public var size: Int

    /// Returns the value of `f(x)` by retrieving it from the table, if it exists there,
    /// or computes it by interpolating between the two values in the table that bracket
    /// the argument `x`. Note that `x` should be in the closed range `[a,b]`. No error
    /// is produced if it's not, and a result is interpolated, but it may be wildly innacurate.
    ///
    /// - Parameter x:
    /// The value for which to retrieve or compute `f(x)`. For accurate results, make sure
    /// that `x` is in the range `[a,b]`.
    ///
    /// - Returns:
    /// The retrieved or computed value of `f(x)`.
    ///
    public func f(_ x: T) -> T

    /// Initialises a look-up table.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///
    ///   - a:
    ///   The lower end of the closed interval `[a,b]` for which to build the look-up table.
    ///   Note that `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition `a < b`.
    ///
    ///   - b:
    ///   The upper end of the closed interval `[a,b]` for which to build the look-up table.
    ///   Note that `a` and `b` must satisfy the condition `a < b`.
    ///
    ///   - dxMin:
    ///   The smallest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    ///   Note that `dxMin` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    ///
    ///   - dxMax:
    ///   The largest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    ///   Note that `dxMax` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    ///
    ///   - df:
    ///   The desired precision for the dependent values `f(x)`.
    ///   Note that `df` must satisfy the condition `df > 0`.
    ///
    ///   - f:
    ///   The function `f(x)` for which to build the look-up table.
    ///
    ///   - fp:
    ///   The function that computes the derivative of `f(x)`.
    ///
    public init?(
        a: T,
        b: T,
        dxMin: T,
        dxMax: T,
        df: T,
        f: @escaping (T) -> T,
        fp: @escaping (T) -> T
    )

}
```

As a useful example in itself, the package also provides the `TrigTable` type, which implements look-up tables for both `sin(x)` and `cos(x)`:

```swift
public struct TrigTable <T: BinaryFloatingPoint> {

    /// The lower end of the canonical interval `[0, pi/2]` for which to build the look-up table.
    public let a: T = .zero

    /// The upper end of the canonical interval `[0, pi/2]` for which to build the look-up table.
    public let b: T = 0.5 * .pi

    /// The smallest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    /// Note that `dxMin` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    public let dxMin: T

    /// The largest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    /// Note that `dxMax` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    public let dxMax: T

    /// The desired precision for the values of `sin(x)` and `cos(x)`.
    /// Note that `df` must satisfy the condition `df > 0`.
    public let df: T

    /// Convenience value.
    public let piOver2 = 0.5 * T.pi

    /// Convenience value.
    public let pi = T.pi

    /// Convenience value.
    public let threePiOver2 = 1.5 * T.pi

    /// Convenience value.
    public let twoPi = 2.0 * T.pi

    /// The number of values stored in the table.
    public var size: Int { sinTable.size }

    /// Returns the value of `sin(x)` by retrieving it from the table, if it exists there,
    /// or computes it by interpolating between the two values in the table that bracket
    /// the argument `x`.
    ///
    /// - Parameter x:
    /// The value for which to retrieve or compute `sin(x)`.
    ///
    /// - Returns:
    /// The retrieved or computed value of `sin(x)`.
    ///
    public func sin(_ x: T) -> T

    /// Returns the value of `cos(x)` using the identity `cos(x) = sin(x + pi/2)`.
    ///
    /// - Parameter x:
    /// The value for which to retrieve or compute `cos(x)`.
    ///
    /// - Returns:
    /// The retrieved or computed value of `cos(x)`.
    ///
    public func cos(_ x: T) -> T

    /// Initialises a look-up table for `sin(x)` and `cos(x)`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///
    ///   - dxMin:
    ///   The smallest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    ///   Note that `dxMin` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    ///
    ///   - dxMax:
    ///   The largest acceptable value of the increment in the independent value `x`.
    ///   Note that `dxMax` must satisfy the conditions `dxMax > dxMin > 0`.
    ///
    ///   - df:
    ///   The desired precision for the values of `sin(x)` and `cos(x)`.
    ///   Note that `df` must satisfy the condition `df > 0`.
    ///
    public init?(dxMin: T, dxMax: T, df: T)

}

Lastly, for a mathematical description of the details involved in building these tables, you may want to take a look at [Designing and building efficient look-up tables](./lookup_tables.pdf). 

## Installation

**LookupTable** is provided only as a Swift Package Manager package, because I'm moving away from CocoaPods and Carthage, and can be easily installed directly from Xcode.
